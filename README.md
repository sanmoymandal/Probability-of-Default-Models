# Probability-of-Default-Models
I have studied the PD models using three different types of models. 
First one is probability of default calculated from Credit score using various combinations of the indiviuals and set a threshold based on credit score.
Second and third ones are logistic regression and decision tree algorithms in ML.
I used Sci-Kitlearn to incorporate the ML algorithms and used matplotlib as well as seaborn packageds to create visualizations.
